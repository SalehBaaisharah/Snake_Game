# Snake Game with Obstacles Project


Welcome to the Snake Game project! This interactive game features a snake, oranges as food, and multi bananas that serve as obstacles throughout the game environment. The game offers various levels of challenge, which you can select at the beginning of each session. As you navigate the snake through the game, your objective is to collect oranges, increase your score, and avoid collisions with the walls. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer.

## Features

- **Level Selection:** Choose the desired level of difficulty before starting the game. Each level presents a unique challenge that tests your skills.

- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Control the movement of the snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Guide the snake to consume oranges while avoiding collisions with the walls.

- **Scoring System:** Increase your score with each orange the snake consumes. The more oranges you eat, the higher your score will be.

- **Obstacles:** Navigate around multi bananas that act as holes in the snake. These obstacles add an extra layer of complexity to the gameplay.

- **Scratch Version:** If you prefer a visual representation of the game, check out the [Snake Game Scratch Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/884043346) to experience the gameplay in an interactive way.

## How to Play

1. **Level Selection:** Upon launching the game, you'll be prompted to enter the desired level. Each level represents a different level of difficulty.

2. **Game Start:** After selecting the level, the game will begin. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the movement of the snake.

3. **Collect Oranges:** Guide the snake to consume oranges that appear throughout the environment. Each orange eaten will increment your score.

4. **Avoid Obstacles:** Watch out for multi bananas scattered across the playing area. These bananas create holes that make the snake go to another place, thus you must navigate around.

5. **Game Over:** The game will end if the snake collides with the walls. Your final score will be displayed, allowing you to track your progress and improvement over time.
